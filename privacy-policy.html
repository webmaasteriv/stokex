                    <h2>Last revised: 25 June, 2021</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy constitutes a part of Binance Terms of Use (the “TOU”). The terms used in
                        this Privacy Policy shall have the same meanings as in the TOU except as otherwise provided
                        herein.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Binance and Binance Operators collect, use, process, disclose,
                        share, transfer, and protect personal information obtained through Binance and its partners. The
                        terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Binance and Binance Operators. When we ask for certain
                        personal information from users, it is because we are required by applicable laws or government
                        orders to collect such information or it is relevant for our specified purposes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Please carefully read the full content of this Privacy Policy. When visiting Binance,
                            regardless of whether or not you register for or log in the Binance Services, you
                            acknowledge, understand, and consent to all articles described in this Privacy
                            Policy.</strong> We will not use your personal information for any purpose not covered in
                        this Privacy Policy or the TOU (including any other business rules of Binance) without prior
                        notification to you and your consent.</p>
                    <p>The latest Privacy Policy has incorporated elements from the General Data Protection Regulation
                        (GDPR) as we act in accordance with its personal information processing rules within the
                        European Economic Area (EEA). We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European
                        Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent
                        for these data transfers to third countries if required by applicable laws.</p>

                        other provisions of this Privacy Policy applies to anonymized or aggregated personal data (i.e.
                        information about our Users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or
                        references an individual User).</p>
                    <p>We may use anonymized or aggregate customer data for any business purpose, including to better
                        understand Users’ needs and behaviors, improve our products and services, conduct business

                        possible to prevent potential fraud and loss of funds to bad actors.</p>
                    <h3>3.3 To Comply with Legal and Regulatory Requirements</h3>
                    <p>With respect to the privacy and security of personal information, we will use the information in

                        information to customize, measure, and improve Binance Services and the content and layout of
                        our websites and apps, and to develop new services.</p>
                    <p>We continuously monitor activity information within our systems and our communications with users

                        agreements with our Users, including but not limited to reviewing, investigating, and preventing
                        any potentially prohibited or illegal activities that may violate the foregoing provisions, or
                        disclose the relevant information to a third party in accordance therewith.</p>
